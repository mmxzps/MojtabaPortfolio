      <h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3> <br>
      <p>My name is Mojtaba, and I'm a curious student in .NET development with a great interest in web design and
        programming. My coding journey began not long ago when I threw  myself into studies of
        .NET. However, my interest in web development has always been there, and it has only grown stronger over time.
        To create websites that are functional, beautiful and easy to navigate around has always attracted me, and that is one of the reasons why I'm now
        exploring the possibilities in both frontend and backend development. <br><br>
        Lately, I have worked with backend development as well, and I must say it has opened up a whole
        new world of possibilities. Being able to create robust and efficient systems that seamlessly work
        together with the frontend is something I would love to learn more about.<br><br>
        Through my portfolio, I hope to share my projects and experiences that I have develope so far, as well as my skills in both web
        design and programming. <br><br>I always strive to learn more and evolve as a developer, and I look forward to
        seeing what the future holds in the world of technology and coding. Thank you for taking the time to
        explore my portfolio, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential
