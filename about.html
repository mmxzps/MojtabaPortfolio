      <h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3> <br>
      <p>My name is Mojtaba, and I'm a curious student in .NET development with a great interest in web design and
        programming. My journey into the world of coding began not long ago when I immersed myself in the studies of
        .NET. However, my interest in web development has always been present, and it has only grown stronger over time.
        Creating beautiful and functional web pages has always attracted me, and that is one of the reasons why I'm now
        exploring the possibilities in both frontend and backend development. <br><br>
        Lately, I've had the pleasure to explore backend development as well, and I must say it has opened up a whole
        new world of exciting possibilities. Being able to create robust and efficient systems that seamlessly work
        together with the aesthetic aspect of web design is something I truly appreciate.<br><br>
        Through my portfolio, I hope to share my projects and experiences, as well as showcase my skills in both web
        design and programming. <br><br>I always strive to learn more and evolve as a developer, and I look forward to
        seeing what the future holds in the exciting world of technology and coding. Thank you for taking the time to
        explore my portfolio, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential
